# Cplusplus---Grocery
This was the final project I created for my CS-210 course at SNHU. 

[1] Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:

This program is given a list of items bought in a grocery store on a single day. The user is given a menu
that offers three options to view the content. The user can view how many times each item was purchased in 
list form (with an integer), search a specific item to see how many times it was purchased, or view the list 
of items purchased as a histogram. It allows the user to view the content in an easy to understand way. 

[2] What did you do particularly well?

I think that I made the program user friendly and easy to understand/operate. I also attempted to explain the 
code using in-line comments for any programmers that wish to understand the logic that I used in creating this 
program. 

[3] Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think that I could have used better naming conventions. I found myself a little bit confused and made a mistake in 
the Python portion of my code because I initially named my dictionary frequency while the text document that I was 
writing to was also called frequency. I'm sure that in no time I will be able to reflect on the project and see obvious
means of improvement, but I genuinely gave this project my best shot and tried to implement the best practices that I am
currently equipped to utilize. I am excited to look back on this project and see room for improvement because that means 
that I have improved as a programmer. 

[4] Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 
    What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
I found it most challenging to write the code for the histogram. I tried and failed multiple times before I was able 
to properly format the output. I then realized that the simplest method was to write a for loop that would print the
symbol to match the number that was passed from the frequency file (written to from Python). This might seem like an 
obvious solution, but sometimes coding solutions don't feel so obvious at the time, haha. I will do my best to continue
practicing these skills so my coding arsenal doesn't feel so clouded and the solutions might come to the surface a bit
more quickly/easily. 

[5] What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think that integrating Python into Visual Studio is a valuable skill that will very likely be helpful in the future. 
I see a lot of value in using multiple coding languages and Python and C++ complement eachother well. 

[6] How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

As I mentioned in point 2, I think that I made the program friendly to both users and collaboraters. I made an effort to 
create an interface that was well formatted and easy to understand. I did this by validating user input every step of the 
way, creating space for readability and formatting an easy to understand menu with instructions. I also included in-line
comments for collaborators/instructors to understand my coding decisions.
